I. Magento Extensions
---------------------

#.	**Do your extensions support multiple domains?**
	One extension is used for only one domain and if you want to use for other domains, you have to purchase this extension again. 
	
#.	**What Magento Editions/Versions is compatible with?**
	Please note Magento 1 and Magento 2 are separate products and if you purchase an extension today,
	you have to select whether you want to purchase it for Magento 1 OR Magento 2. If you purchased a Magento 1 extension,
	you will need to re-purchase the extension for Magento 2, as Magento 2 is a completely new system and not a simple upgrade.
	All our extensions had to be developed from scratch for Magento 2
