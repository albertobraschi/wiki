Magento Extensions
---------------------

Do your extensions support multiple domains?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


One extension is used for only one domain and if you want to use for other domains, you have to purchase this extension again. 
	
What Magento Editions/Versions is compatible with?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please note Magento 1 and Magento 2 are separate products and if you purchase an extension today,
you have to select whether you want to purchase it for Magento 1 OR Magento 2. If you purchased a Magento 1 extension,
you will need to re-purchase the extension for Magento 2, as Magento 2 is a completely new system and not a simple upgrade.
All our extensions had to be developed from scratch for Magento 2

Our Magento 1 extensions are compatible with: 

	.. role:: menu
		
	:menu:`Community: 1.4.x.x, 1.5.x.x, 1.6.x.x, 1.7.x.x, 1.8.x.x, 1.9.x.x`

	:menu:`Enterprise:1.12.x.x, 1.13.x.x, 1.14.x.x`

Our Magento 2 extensions are compatible with all current versions of Community and Enterprise

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our extensions are compatible with all popular browsers such as IE, Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox, Opera. 

Can I request trial?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We do not provide trial versions for our extensions. 
However, we are happy to offer 30-day money back guarantee if our extensions fail to function properly due to a bug and we cannot support to fix it. 
However, we always try our best to assist customer in solving problems. 

How can I receive the updated version?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When BSSCommerce publishes new version of any product, 
please take notice of the release note tab in the product page to get the update news about the new version. 
Customers purchased product from us can get the updated version by contacting us via email; 
we will send the new package version once we receive this kind of request. 
In addition, you can go to My Account-> My Downloadable Products to download the latest version of the extension. 

Can I get the updated versions of extensions for free?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, of course. However, please remember that we do not provide free service (including free support and installation service) for updated versions.

Are your extensions compatible with 3rd-party extensions?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of our extensions were tested in clean Magento installations without third party extensions and we can't 
make sure whether they are compatible with 3rd party extensions or not. Therefore, 
in case you are not sure about the comparability of our extensions with other 3rd party extensions installed on your site in advance,
please contact us for more information before your purchase.
