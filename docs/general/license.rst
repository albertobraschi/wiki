License
=======

This license agreement is an agreement between BSSCommerce and you (the person or company who is being licensed to use extensions). 
The agreement applies to all extensions and services you purchase from us. 

When you buy and use our products, you acknowledge that you have read this agreement and agree with all the content and terms of the agreement and comply it seriously. 
 
This agreement takes effective at the moment when you order extensions from our site or receive it through email or on data medium or by any other means. 
 
**1.	License**

This agreement gives you the right to use only one license for one extension to install for your site. 
This license remains valid until when you do not want to continue using the module and uninstall from your Magento site or you break terms of the agreement. 
In addition, when you want to install the extension for another domain, you are required to purchase a separate license. 

You just own a copy of extension to install for you site. Therefore, you are not allowed to distribute our extension for any third parties for non-commercial 
or commercial purposes without our permission. Every distribution by your own decision is regarded as the violation of this Agreement and entails liability, 
according to the current law.

You may not use any part of the code in whole or part in any other software or product or website.

You may not give, sell, sub-license, rent, lease or lend any portion of our extensions to anyone. You may not place the extension on a server so that it is 
accessible via a public network such as the Internet for distribution purposes.

**2.	Termination**

In the issue of termination, if you fail in the compliance with terms and conditions of this License Agreement such as any violations of the agreement, 
BSSCommerce will terminate this license at any time.  Your license to use our extension is revoked and you must destroy all copies of the extension on your site.

After we give you a notice of license termination, if you continue to use the module, you hereby agree to accept an injunction to enjoin you from its further use 
and to pay all costs (including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees) to enforce our revocation of your license and any damages suffered by us because of 
your misuse of the extension. In addition, we are not bound to return you all amount spent on the purchase of the extension for the termination of this license.

  
**3.	Limitation of Liability**

BSSCommerce are not responsible for any damages on your site such as loss of profits/saving or loss of information which are not caused by the use of our 
extension. 
We are not also liable for any prosecution arising from use of the extension against law or for any illegal use.

**4.	Laws**

We are the copyright holder of the extension. The module or a portion of it is a copyrightable matter and is liable to protection by the law. 
Any activity that infringes terms of this Agreement violates copyright law and will be prosecuted according to the current law. 

In case you are holding an invalid license, we will reserve the right to revoke the license
