Common Problems 
================

I purchased "Delete Order/Invoice/Shipment/Credit Memo". I uploaded the files to my root folder now I get this page "Service Temporarily Unavailable 
The server is temporarily unable to service your request due to maintenance downtime or capacity problems. Please try again later." --> Could you please 
try to check if there is a file called maintenance.flag in your magento root? If so Delete it. The problem will be sorted out.
