**What are the differencies between version 1 and version 2 of BSS Delete Order extension? Is version 2 the upgraded and better one?**

In facts, BSS Delete Order version 2 is the upgraded one to be able to compatible with Magento 2 platform. But basics function of the 
version 2, for now, is simplier (only enables deleting orders along with all other relating data at the same time) and you cannot remove unwanted 
invoices, shipment and credit memos separately. In other words, version 1 is the more full-function one. 

**If I delete a piece of data using this extension, is other relating data/information deleted either?**

When deleting unnecessary orders, all respective shipment, invoices, credit memo are deleted too. However, when you only delete any data of 
shipment, invoices, credit memo, its order still remains under your control

**Is is posible to choose to delete all types of unneccesary data in one click, or I have to do it seperately for each type?**

Yes, by deleting orders, other data relating to it will be wiped out immediately. In case you want to keep orders data, deleting other types 
of info will have to be done seperately.

**Using this extension, if I delete a certain order by mistake, is it moved to a folder like recycle bin from which I can find and restore it or it 
is deleted for good?**

Unfortunately, the answer is no. When you delete an order, it is deleted permanently and can not be restore. So before hitting the **Submit** button 
for this action, please take a second look carefully
