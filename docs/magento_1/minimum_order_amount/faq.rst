Features

**1. I'd like to experience this helpful extension but what if it conflicts with my using theme?**

:bullet:`That's` not a problem because this one is built well-compatible with all Magento themes. This module has nothing to do with display customization 
in the frontend, so it has no effect on whatever theme you are using on your site
 

**2. Why should i use this module when requirement of minimum order amount may make my customers feel annoyed because of their limited budget?**

:bullet:`When deciding whether to use this module or not`, you have to thoroughly consider  your business model and your targeted customers. Sometimes, delivery 
of orders with tiny amount are not cost-efficient for your business, then you can avoid it by setting up a minimum order amount for your customer.

**3. Magento also has a default minimum order amount function, so why should i use another extension like BSS Minimum Order Amount for my website?**

:bullet:`The reason` why we develop this extension is to optimize the similar default function in Magento. Magento itself just allows you to set up a 
specific minimum order amount for the whole website, meanwhile our extension enables you to choose different minimum amounts for different 
customer groups, especially at the scope of a storeview only. It is super convenient when your website has multi-store view.


**4. Using this module, whether discount is included in total amount when compraring with minimum order amount or not?**

:bullet:`The amount` to compare with minimum level is the subtotal after discount is applied.


**5. Does this module set limitation to the number of customer groups on which i want to place minimum order amount?**

:bullet:`No`. You can manage the number of your customer groups and the limit of their order value also

**6. What is the difference between Descripton message and Error to show in shopping cart?**

:bullet:`They work quite similarly`, both are customized message to inform customers that they still can not check out. Description message will be displayed 
in shopping cart when the subtotal after discount is less than minimum amount, and Error to show in shopping cart will only be shown when customers click on 
the button Proceed to checkout
