BSS Unboxed extension overview
-------------------------------

`Magento Unboxed Extension <http://bsscommerce.com/magento-unboxed-extension.html>`_ creatively uses customer unboxed product images as effective social 
proofs to attribute on marketing efforts. The extension shows customer product images of your products they have JUST purchased in a particular area and 
indirectly uses those images to attract more customers and make the higher conversion rate. There is beyond two facts that: "when buying new items, whether 
in direct or indirect ways, clients are likely to show them off and want to receive compliments from others."

Not a few people are influenced by mob mentality. People are easily impacted by their peers to ratify assertive behaviors, follow trends to buy items. There is 
also no deny that the power of visual content marketing can become magical: "Use a picture. It's worth a thousand words."
